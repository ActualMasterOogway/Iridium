# Iridium - Luau Bytecode Deserializer

Iridium is a powerful Luau bytecode deserializer and disassembler written in Luau itself. It allows you to analyze, inspect, and understand compiled Luau bytecode by breaking it down into its constituent components.

## Description

Iridium provides a comprehensive toolkit for working with Luau bytecode. It can parse bytecode from various Luau versions (3-6) and extract detailed information about functions, constants, instructions, and more. This makes it an invaluable tool for reverse engineering, debugging, and understanding how Luau code is executed at a low level.

## Usage

```luau
local Iridium, Types = require("Iridium"), require("Iridium/Types")

-- Deserialize bytecode from a string or buffer
local deserialized = Iridium:Deserialize(bytecodeData)

-- Access function information
local mainFunction = deserialized.Protos[deserialized.ProtoEntryPoint]

-- Inspect instructions
for i, instruction in ipairs(mainFunction.Instructions) do
    print(instruction.Code, instruction.Operands.A, instruction.Operands.B, instruction.Operands.C)
end

-- Access constants
for i, constant in ipairs(mainFunction.Constants) do
    print(constant.ClassName, constant)
end
```
